  long_description: The Inclusion Bot is a Slack bot that passively listens for
    language with racist, ableist, sexist, or other exclusionary histories. When
    it hears such words or phrases, it quietly lets the speaker know and offers
    some suggestions â€” helping nudge us all to thoughtful, inclusive language.
